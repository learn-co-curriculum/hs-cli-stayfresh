Test your command line skills with Terminus, a text-based adventure game. You are a wizard in training, learning the spells of the great masters. You are told you are on a quest to find the sudo password, needing to enlist the help of your elf friend. As you interact with the environment, move through the world, and reach the end of the first level, you are given a series of tasks that will keep you on your terminal toes. Get playing [here](http://www.mprat.org/Terminus/).
